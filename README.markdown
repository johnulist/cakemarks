# cakemarks

cakemarks is a single user bookmark web application using
[CakePHP](http://cakephp.org).

It can store your bookmarks and offers a page which shows you the most relevant
of your bookmarks.


## Why?

Bookmarks are nice to have across all your devices and browsers, but there is
hardly a bookmark syncing tool that covers all of them. Some of these tools are
restricted to a certain browser or do not support one of your browsers. Since
this is just a webpage, this problem does not arrive. The integration in your
browser is not as close, but this enables cakemarks to work with virtually
every browser.


## Installation

Download the [CakePHP
1.3.11](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/zipball/1.3.11) and extract it. Then
place this into the `app/` directory, replacing all the files that came with
CakePHP in this folder.


## Requirements

* CakePHP 1.3.11
* Webspace
* PHP
* MySQL


# TODO
